On the 2621: of anuary 1857, the Msster of the Rolls
submitted to the Tressury s propossl for the publication
of materiale for the History of this Couutry from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry V111.

The Msster of the Rolls suggested that these msterisls
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange-
ment, without mutilationi or abridgmene, preference being
given, in the first instance, vo such mavei-1⁸1³ as were most
scal-ce and vsluable.

He proposed that each chrouicle or historical document
ω be edited should be treated* m the same way as if the
editor were engaged uu an Editio Princeps, and for this
purpose the most oon-eet text should be formed from an
securare collstion of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculim-ides ; that he should sdd to the work s brief
account of the life aud times of the author, and any
zema-ks necessary to explsin the chronology· but no other
note or comment was ω be allowed, except what might be
necessary to establish the correctness of the text ’
