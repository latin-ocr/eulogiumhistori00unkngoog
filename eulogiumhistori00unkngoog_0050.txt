nervod in the Libmry of Caius Collega, Cambridge, os n
similu- insomne by mother monymoua annotator, from
the sune words, in the preswe to the mmo legend in
MS. No. 72 of that collection, “he might have been Δ
'‘ monk of my other monastery dedicated w S. Thomna
'¹ of Canterbury slsewhmss' He certainly oould not
have been ι mouk¹ of Chrisvzhureh, Omtarbury, for
the “patron minu¹' of that foundation were Our Inrd,
the Blaesed Vixgin, md the Holy Trinity3 nor of S. Διι-
gunbine'n without the walls of emm-bury, for the
“patron minist* of that monnsoery was S. Augustiue;
but he might have been ι monk of may of the
religione fou-:datione deffiawd vo S. Thomu ἢ Beket,
though it is hy no means a. necessary insenum, stom hin
employment os the words just quoted, ssat he wan so.
For ho might have used fflhem:

1. If he had been named nster S. Thomu the martyr!

Ξ. If, ou auur-ing the monastic lise, he bad changed hin
nune ιο Thomas,⁸ and speeinlly dedimted himself
