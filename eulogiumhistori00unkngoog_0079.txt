thiu martyr-dom is notice& under the pontificma of
S. Pius.

The date of the martyrdom of SS. Caecilia end
vuarim (μ 178) «flagras with both che daces in
the legende (p. 777) by differenoes os four and
seven yeus respectively, while that assigned ὺο the
mnrtynlom of SS. Quiricus and Julitta ia concordant
with the same authority (p. 8⁵2). The date of the
Panion of the E'leven Thonsand Virgine agrees with
the first date in the Legenda (p. 704). The next
dnm, the-11 of the oonseeration of S. Hillary, is less
hy ons hundred and one yeus than the dete about

Cnthage in the Eulogium (conv.) into the eorre-

date of the anartyrdom of SS. Prothns md Hya-

but the martyr-dom of S. Euphemin is nseigned tro
AD. 278 instead os AD. 280, the date in the Le-
